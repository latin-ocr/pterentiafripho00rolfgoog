ACT IV.

Sem 1.

CHREMES arrives home, and explains to his brother that his second wife, together with
her daughter and her nurse, lest Lemnos before his arrival, and that they are now
in Athens. He has heard of ANTn’no’s marriage, and expresses to his brother his
regret at the failure of their original plan, since now he must marry his unacknowledged
daughter to some stranger, who will not have the same interest DEMIPHO would
have had in keeping her birth a secret. DEMIPHO promises to do his best to bring
about the previous arrangement, in spite of his son’s unfortunate marriage.

[Enter DEMIPHO and CHREMES from Harbor, L.]
