PREFACE. ἐ

---..

Tffls edition of the Pnommo, while prepared especially to meet the
needs of the F reshman Latin Classes in HARVARD Coum-102, will, it is
hoped, be found useful in other institutions where attention is given to
sight-reading.

With the exception of a few ‚minor changes in punctuation, the text
of CARL DzlA'rzxo (Leipzig, 1884') has been followed without deviation.

My thanks are due to Pnor. J. B. GREENOUGH for valuable suggestionS,
and to Paos. J. C. Rom-E, of the Umvmzsrrv OF MICHIGAN, for assistance ·

in proof-reading. FRANK w NICOLSON
