From GETA’s conversation with DAvus it appears (1) that PHAEDRu is in love with a ’
music-girl owned by DORIO, but is unable to buy her for want of means 3 (2) that
ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ, having fallen in love with a beautiful stranger, an orphan, has been enabled to
marry her through the machinations of a Parasite, PHORM10 by name, wh0‚ taking
advantage os a law nt Athens which compels the next os kin of a female orphan either
to marry her or to give her a dowry, and pretending to be ο. friend of the girl's family,
has by process os law compelled ΑΝΤΙΡΗΟ to wed her. A letter has been received
announcing the speedy return os ΒΕΜΙΡΗΟ, to which event GE'rA looks sorward with
much apprehension.
