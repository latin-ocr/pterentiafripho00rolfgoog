INTRODUCTION.

Two old Athenian citizens, Dmnmo and CHREMES, brothers, have left Athens, the
former to go to Cilicia, the latter to Lemnos· On departing they placed their sons,
named respectively ΑΝΤῙΡΗΟ and PHAEDRIA, in charge of Dammo’s slave GETA. The
ostensible object of CHREMES'S journey to Lemnos was to collect the rents of some estates
owned there by his rich wife NAUSISTRATA3 his real purpose to bring back with him to
Athens a young girl, ΡΗΛΝΙυΜ, his daughter by a second wife whom he has secretly
married, under the name of STILPO‚ in one of his previous visits to that island. It has
been previously arranged between the two old men that the girl on her arrival shall be
married to ΑΝΤῙΡΗΟ, and they hope to carry out this plan in such a way that no suspicion
shall arise in Athens as to her parentage. Here begins the action of the play, while the
fathers are still absent.
