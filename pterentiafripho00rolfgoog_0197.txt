HE editor believes that the poems of Ovid are, ae regards both
style and subject-matter, admirably adapted to serve ae an
introduction to the study of Latin Poetry. He has therefore fur-
nished the book with copious notee suited to the needs of young
studente, supplemented with grammatical references and an intro-
duction on the life and works of ovid, and on mythology.
' The selections were chosen with a view to making the study of
Latin interesting. Most of them are from the Metamorphoses, of
which about one-third has been taken. By help of the argument,
which is given in full, the editor has endeavored not merely to
show the connection of the tales and the ingenuity of the transi-
tione, —necessary to comprehend the poem as a whole,— but to
put before the reader something like a complete picture of the
Greek mythology, at least of those narratives which have held
their permanent place in the modern mind and have entered more
or less into every modern literature.

The first eighty-eight linee of Book I. have been omitted because
of their difficulty and lack of interest. From the Fasti three selec-
tione are given3 from the HeroideS, one; from the Amores, three3
from the Tristia, five3 and of the letters from Pontus, one. Special
care has been taken to preserve the more interesting biographical
hints of the lesser poems.

Professor Greenough's vocabulary, similar in style and character
to his Caesar, cicere, and Virgil vocabularies‚ will doubtless be ready
before the autumn of 1891. In the meantime Allen's Lexicon
will fill its place.
