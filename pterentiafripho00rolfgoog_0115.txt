ACT IV.
SCENE 1.

E nter CHREMES from his house.

CHREMES pities MENEDEMUS because BAccffls has taken up her abode with him, but
thinks that he will endure the infliction for a time, on account of his joy at his son's
return. SYRUS tells CHREMES that CLINIA is making his father believe that BAccms
is CLmPHo'S mistress, while he himself pretends to be in love with ANTIPHILA‚ hoping
to get money out of his father for wedding expenses. SYRUS advises CHREMES to
feign consent to the marriage os CLINIA and ANTIPHILA. He refuseS, but consents to
pay BAccms a sum of money which Simus pretends is due her from ANTIPHILA'S
foster-mother, and, to keep up the illusion (as he thinks) that she is CLITIPHO’S mis·
tress, sends it to her by his son's hand.
