Enter CHREMES from his house.

A night is supposed to pass between the second and third acts. At daybreak CHREMES
goes to tell MENssDfflus that Cuma has returned. He informs Mananmus that the
youth is accompanied by an extravagant mistress, but MENEDEuus is determined to
put up with anything, if only his son will remain at home. CHREMES, however, per-
suades him that, is he is determined to indulge his son, it will be better not to do so
openly.
