SCENE 4.

Enter, from CHREMES’S house, SosTRATA and tlte NURSE. Sos‘rRATA holds
a ring in her hand, and is greatly excited.

AN'HPHILA is found to be CHREMES’S daughter. Some years before, SOSTRATA, wife of
CHREMES, had been ordered to expose an infant daughter. She had left with the child
a ring, which she now finds in possession os ANTIPHILA. The nurse also recognizes
the ring. SOSTRATA consesses to her husband that, instead of exposing the infant, she
had given it into the charge of an old Corinthian woman. CHREMES is indignant at
her thoughtless conduct, but finally forgives her, and goes with her to see ANTIPHILA.
