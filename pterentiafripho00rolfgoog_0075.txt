PREFACE.

 

Tm: general plan of this little book, which it is hoped may be found
useful for sight reading, was suggested by MR. PREBLE’S “ADELPHOE.”

The text is that of C. DZ1ATz1<o (Leipzig, 1884), with some unimportant
changes in punctuation.

In some of the stage. directions 1 have ventured, for the sake of viv-
idnesS, to indicate gestures which a modern actor would use under the
circumstances, although we have no evidence for believing that a Roman
actor would have expressed himself in the same way. ι

1 am under great obligations to PROF. F RANCIS W. KELSEY of the
UNWERsrrv op M1cn1cAN, and MR. FRANK W. N1coLsoN, Instructor in
HARvARD UNIVERsrrv, who have read the proofS, and given me many

valuable suggestions.
