GENERAL INTRODUCFION.

MENEDEMUS, the “sels-tormentor,” is a citizen of Athens», whose only son CLINIA fell
in love with ANTIPHILA. MENEDEMUS bitterly opposed his son’s marriage to a portionless
stranger, and by his harshness and taunts finally drove him to leave home and go to the
wars in Asia. After he had gone, MENEDEMUS was filled with remorse. He sold his
estate in Athens and moved to the country, where we find him punishing himself by
laboring incessantly, and living a life of ex'treme frugality. CLINIA has returned, unknown
to his father, and is staying with an intimate friend, CLITIPHO, whose father, CHREMES,
is MENEDEMUS’S next door neighbor in the country. The details of the plot are given
in the introductions at the beginning of each scene.
