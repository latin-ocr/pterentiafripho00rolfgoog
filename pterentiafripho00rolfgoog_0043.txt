Commodius esse opinor duplici spe titier.

Petam hinc unde a primo institi: is si dat, sat est;

si ab eo nil fiet, tum hunc adoriar h6spitem. (Cras-ses the 605
stage towards the old men, who are standing
in frent qs CHREMES'S house.)

SCENE3.

GETA informs the old men that he has concluded an arrangement by which they can get

rid of the unwelcome bride. PHORMIQ though pretending to be betrothed to a rich
girl, has consented, in order to avoid further quarrels‚ to marry the stranger, if they
will give him along with her sufficient dowry to puy his debts. He names thirty
minae, the sum required by PHAEDRIA. DEMIPHO refuses; but CHREMES, in his caget-
ness for the arrangement, consents to pay the money out of his own pocket. ANTIPHO
is present unobserved during the interview, and naturally considers himself betrayed
by GETA. χ

[Enter Ammo from DEMIPHO'S house. He remains in the backgrounac

unnoticed by the others, all through the scene]
